Let me analyze how the game determines snippet correctness by tracing through the relevant files and code paths.

First, let's look at how snippets are stored and managed:

1. In the admin dashboard (`src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`), snippets are created with an `isValid` boolean property that determines whether they should be merged or rejected. This is set when adding new snippets:

```135:135:src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx
const handleAddSnippet = async () => {
```

2. The snippet structure is defined in `src/types.ts`:

```typescript:28:35:src/types.ts
export type CodeSnippet = {
  id: Id<"codeSnippets">;
  code: string;
  language: Language;
  isValid: boolean;
  difficulty: Difficulty;
  explanation: string;
  volume: number;
};
```

3. The actual game logic for checking correctness is in `GameContainer.tsx`. The key function is `handleVote`:

```301:301:src/components/GameContainer.tsx
const handleVote = (isCorrect: boolean) => {
```

Here's how it works:

1. When a snippet is loaded in the game, it comes with its `isValid` property from the database
2. When the user clicks "Merge" or "Reject":
   - "Merge" button sends `isCorrect = true`
   - "Reject" button sends `isCorrect = false`
3. The game compares the user's vote against the snippet's `isValid` property:
   - If the vote matches `snippet.isValid`, the answer is correct
   - If the vote doesn't match `snippet.isValid`, the answer is incorrect

So the formula is simply:

```
isAnswerCorrect = (isCorrect === snippet.isValid)
```

The connection flow is:

1. Admin creates snippets and sets their validity in the admin dashboard
2. These snippets are stored in the Convex database with their `isValid` property
3. During gameplay, the game loads snippets and compares the user's vote against this stored `isValid` value

The key files and line numbers involved are:

1. `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx:135` - Where snippets are created with their validity
2. `src/types.ts:28-35` - Where the CodeSnippet type is defined including the isValid property
3. `src/components/GameContainer.tsx:301` - Where the vote handling and correctness checking occurs

This is a straightforward true/false comparison system where the admin-set validity is the source of truth for what constitutes a correct or incorrect answer.
